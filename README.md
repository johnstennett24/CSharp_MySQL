# Overview
I am trying to learn more about mySQL so that I can build a WebAPI in C# and connect it to a mobile app written in Flutter

This C# progam is written to access a database and return the results in methods.

My purpose for creating this software is to help me learn how to make SQL queries and transactions in C# so that I can connect it to a WebAPI in C# later on
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

For this project I developed it in Rider by JetBrains, Ride is a C# and .NET IDE comparable to Visual Studio. I also use a Macbook Pro with an M1 Pro chip

This program is written in C#, C# is an object oriented programming language that is ran on the .NET framework by Microsoft. If you are a Java or C++
developer, C# is very similar and you can pick it up very easily.

# Useful Websites

* [C# and MySQL guide](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-net/en/)
* [C# and .NET docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

# Run the Program

  * To run the progam you will need to have C# and .NET installed on your local machine.
  
  ## Instructions
    1. Install C# and .NET 6.0
    2. Clone this repository
    3. Make sure you have a mySQL server running on your local machine.
    4. open a new terminal and type 'dotnet build' 
    5. Once you recieve a 'build succesecul' notification, type 'dotnet run'
